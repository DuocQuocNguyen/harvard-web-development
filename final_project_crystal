Project name (subject to change)
Crystal Clear
Pun, embodying Crystal’s focus on transparent on sustainable fashion praxis

Goal(s)
Freelance Simulator
Capture and work through a process that involves multiple parties (me, Crystal, code reviewers, etc) that mimic the collaborations found in freelancing. 

Stack Exploration
Build portfolio using new technologies (i.e. UX/UI rooted in Material Design concepts and using Materialize libraries) to expand web dev skillsets.

Dynamic Portfolio
Achieve a workable + sustainable portfolio for the designer, that can be changed and altered by the designer with minimal background in web dev - user friendly. Capturing the Designer’s overall aesthetic and feel through design and structure. 

Development
Stack:
Material Design philosophy (https://material.io/design/introduction/#principles)
Materialize framework/library (https://materializecss.com/)
Lottie inspired animations (https://airbnb.design/introducing-lottie/)
JQuery + VanillaJS
SCSS (Less & Sass)
HTML5 & CSS3

Tools:
Terminal - iTerm 2 (mac/unix)
CyberDuck (if FTP)
Git + GitHub (temporary hosting until launch)
Sublime Text / PHPStorm

Hosting:
Using Github as a temporary means of hosting until launch (also for financial consideration) or Designer’s choice of web hosting and or changes in Domain. 

Audiences:
Primary - Designer. The main goal is to have the designer have a portfolio that they can alter and change depending on their projects and development. Preferably a sustainable site that they can fiddle with and have a limited but full range of expressions. 
Secondary - Designer’s clients.  Potential SEO and Conversions can also use this as a baseline for who they may choose to work with. They’ll have access to completed projects, a lookbook, collections, work-in-progress, & Designer’s info/bio, etc.
